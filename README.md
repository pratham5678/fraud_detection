# Online Transaction Fraud Detection

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to detect fraudulent transactions from an online transaction dataset. It performs data exploration, visualization, and builds a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or not.

The goal is to demonstrate how transaction data can be analyzed and used to predict fraud patterns using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, and `scikit-learn`.

## âœ… Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and missing values check.
- Visualization using Plotly's interactive pie chart to show distribution of transaction types.
- Correlation analysis between transaction attributes and fraud occurrence.
- Preprocessing of categorical data by mapping transaction types to numeric values.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- Model training using `DecisionTreeClassifier`.
- Prediction on new transaction data.
- Model evaluation using accuracy.
